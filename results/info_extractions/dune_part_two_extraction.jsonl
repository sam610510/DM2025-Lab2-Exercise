that feels massive in scope, yet intimate and personal in its story.\nIt is insurmountably challenging not to be romantic about these films. From the sweeping soundscapes to the larger-than-life imagery, Dune dares you not to disappear into its breathtakingly exotic world.\nTimothée Chalamet returns as Paul Atreides, giving a layered performance. The script challenges the audience with him in particular.\nThere is also a love story with the wonderful Zendaya, playing Chani. She is given so much agency and identity that it feels like a completely different character from the book, operating as her own person rather than just a love interest.\nThis results in an interesting tug-of-war in not only Paul and Chani but the entire Fremen race.\nThe only area I'd say the film didn't wow me was the score. I enjoyed Hans Zimmer's soundtrack for the first Dune, but nothing really in Part Two jumped out and registered with me. It's not bad by any means, it just didn't strike me like the first one did.\nHowever, the overall sound design was nuts, especially with the IMAX speakers, which caused the bassy vibrations to literally shake my core in one scene.\nAustin Butler embodies the villainous role of Feyd-Rautha; he is a force to be reckoned with, striking fear into the hearts of the other characters and the audience.\nVilleneuve’s hand with it all is an elegant sledgehammer, bashing us around the head about things we should already be able to see for ourselves but clearly can’t.\n\"\"\"\n", "document_id": "doc_0ce769a0"}
