      "1.  **Supervised Learning:** This means the algorithm learns from a \"training dataset\" that consists of input data points *and their corresponding correct class labels*. The model learns the patterns and relationships between the input features and the output classes.\n",

      "\n",
      "\t\t Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed, ML algorithms use statistical techniques to enable systems to 'learn' from data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions without human intervention. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Types of Machine Learning \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Common types include supervised learning (learning from labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error with rewards and penalties). \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Applications \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t ML is used in a wide range of applications, such as image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis. \n",

      "\n",
      "\t\t A data center is a dedicated physical facility that an organization uses to house its critical IT infrastructure, including servers, storage systems, networking equipment, and related components. These facilities are designed to provide a secure, reliable, and controlled environment for computing operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Key Components \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Essential components include servers, storage devices, network switches and routers, power supplies (including UPS and generators), cooling systems (HVAC), and physical security measures. \n",

      "\t\t Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence model that are trained on massive amounts of text data. They are designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. LLMs are characterized by their enormous size (billions or trillions of parameters) and their ability to perform a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. \n",

      "\t Capabilities \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs can perform tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, question answering, code generation, and creative writing. They learn complex linguistic patterns, grammar, facts, and reasoning abilities from their training data. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Underlying Technology \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are typically built using deep learning architectures, most notably the Transformer architecture, which allows them to process sequential data like text very effectively. \n",

      "\t Data Centers as the Foundation for LLMs and ML \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Training and running LLMs, as well as many other complex machine learning models, requires immense computational power and vast amounts of data storage. Data centers provide the necessary infrastructure – high-performance servers, specialized hardware (like GPUs and TPUs), robust networking, and reliable power – to handle these computationally intensive tasks. Without data centers, it would be practically impossible to develop, train, and deploy LLMs at scale. \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

      "other crime movies, its ingenious concept keeps us on the edge \n",

      "committed according to the 7 deadly sins: Sloth, Gluttony, \n",
      "Greed, Lust, Envy, Pride and Wrath. This already denotes that \n",
      "the killer wishes to send a message through these acts, they have \n",
      "a meaning and a purpose. Throughout the film, we observe how \n",

      "identity remains anonymous to the other characters as well as \n",

      "plot feel more real, as it raises real questions and feelings. This is haunting because Se7en is an extremely dark \n",
      "cinematic piece, which therefore means that on a certain level, this dark view matches our own reality. The cast is \n",

      "quite interesting because that means it could be anywhere. The haunting darkness remains throughout the whole \n",

      "There is no right way to describe the ending of this film in words, as one must see it themselves to truly \n",
      "understand, but it revolves around the killer finding a way to strongly prove his twisted point and leave an ever-\n",

      "completely turned upside down. It is very poignant, while being extremely clever at the same time. It does not \n",

    "It is insurmountably challenging not to be romantic about these films. From the sweeping soundscapes to the larger-than-life imagery, Dune dares you not to disappear into its breathtakingly exotic world.\n",
    "Timothée Chalamet returns as Paul Atreides, giving a layered performance. The script challenges the audience with him in particular.\n",
    "There is also a love story with the wonderful Zendaya, playing Chani. She is given so much agency and identity that it feels like a completely different character from the book, operating as her own person rather than just a love interest.\n",
    "This results in an interesting tug-of-war in not only Paul and Chani but the entire Fremen race.\n",
    "The only area I'd say the film didn't wow me was the score. I enjoyed Hans Zimmer's soundtrack for the first Dune, but nothing really in Part Two jumped out and registered with me. It's not bad by any means, it just didn't strike me like the first one did.\n",
    "However, the overall sound design was nuts, especially with the IMAX speakers, which caused the bassy vibrations to literally shake my core in one scene.\n",
    "Austin Butler embodies the villainous role of Feyd-Rautha; he is a force to be reckoned with, striking fear into the hearts of the other characters and the audience.\n",

    "1. Separation: In the 3D graph, points that appeared overlapping in the 2D plot may be separated due to the additional dimension. This indicates that the overlap of certain emotions in the 2D projection was merely visual, whereas they are actually distinct within the higher-dimensional semantic space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Spatial Structure: 3D graphs can reveal more complex geometric structures. For instance, a cluster of a specific emotion might exhibit a \"spiral\" or \"shell-like\" distribution. Such structures would be flattened into a single mass in a 2D projection and can only be fully discerned when observing the graph through rotation in 3D space.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Information Retention: Although 3D is still the result of dimensionality reduction, it retains more variance from the original high-dimensional space (3072 dimensions) compared to 2D. Consequently, the distances calculated in this space usually reflect the similarity of the original data more accurately than in 2D."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "The model answered the question accurately. Using RAG, it successfully retrieved the definition of Chain-of-thought (CoT) from the Wikipedia page. It correctly identified CoT as a technique that enables LLMs to solve multi-step problems by breaking them down into intermediate reasoning steps. This response was grounded in the source text, citing origins from Google Research, rather than relying on general knowledge.\n",

    "2. Did it miss important information? \n",

    "The definition was complete, but some specific examples might have been omitted.\n",
    "Included: The key concept that CoT improves reasoning by mimicking a \"train of thought\".\n",
    "Potentially Missed: The source text includes a math word problem example (about apples in a cafeteria). Depending on the retrieval chunk size, this example might not have been included in the generated summary. However, the core definition remained precise"

    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
    "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Structure:**\n",

    "Zero-shot: Performed surprisingly well for \"Anger\" and \"Joy,\" suggesting strong pre-trained knowledge for these distinct emotions. However, it failed to distinguish \"Fear\" effectively, often confusing it with anger.\n",

    "1-shot: This method was a mixed bag. It significantly helped identifying \"Fear,\" correcting the major weakness of the 0-shot model. However, it degraded performance for \"Anger,\" possibly due to a non-representative single example that skewed the model's understanding. It had no impact on \"Joy\" or \"Sadness.\"\n",

    "5-shot: This method generally offered the most balanced performance. It maintained the gains in \"Fear,\" restored some performance in \"Anger,\" and significantly improved \"Sadness\" detection.

    "Discussion of Findings :\n",
    "\n",
    "Case A: Improvement (Wrong to Right)\n",
    "\n",
    "These cases often involve texts where the emotion is subtle, sarcastic, or relies on specific vocabulary that the zero-shot model misinterprets. For example, a text expressing \"Fear\" might be aggressively phrased, leading a zero-shot model to predict \"Anger.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 5-shot examples likely acted as a calibration mechanism. By seeing 5 distinct examples of what constitutes \"Fear\" in this specific dataset (perhaps including aggressive fear responses), the model adjusted its internal boundary for that class, allowing it to correctly classify the previously mislabeled text. This demonstrates the core benefit of few-shot learning: in-context adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case B: No Improvement (Wrong to Wrong)\n",
    "\n",
    "These texts are often highly ambiguous, contain mixed emotions, or lack sufficient emotional keywords entirely. For instance, a tweet might describe a sad event but use neutral or even \"joyful\" words (e.g., \"laughing through the pain\"), confusing both the zero-shot and few-shot models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 examples are simply not enough to cover every linguistic variation or edge case. If the test sample is an outlier (e.g., very short, contains slang not present in the examples), the few-shot prompt fails to provide the necessary guidance. The model likely falls back on its pre-trained biases, which were incorrect in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case C: Worsened (Right to Wrong)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most counter-intuitive case. A zero-shot model, using its vast general knowledge, correctly identified the emotion. However, after adding 5 examples, the model got it wrong. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is often due to negative transfer or overfitting to the context. The 5 examples might have introduced a specific bias. For example, if all 5 \"Joy\" examples were about \"winning sports,\" the model might start associating \"Joy\" only with sports-related keywords. If the test text was about \"winning a lottery\" (a different kind of joy), the model might reject \"Joy\" and predict something else, whereas the zero-shot model (which has a broader definition of Joy) got it right. The constraints of the few-shot prompt inadvertently narrowed the model's understanding too much."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
